* Chunking
  - Understanding the components that make up a word/idea
  - A concept to keep in mind when taking notes to get a better understanding of new concepts
  - Makes it easier to look back on
* Semi-Lattice
  - Regarding images and the format of note taking
  - Incorportating images within the notes can help grasp new concepts better
  - Depends on the context/topic, but should be included when necessary
* 内言語/外言語
  - Language/word choice used inside/outside your brain
  - Note taking can be done in 内言語, a benefit being that it can be kept simple and consice
  - Can turn problematic if exact definitions of certain words being used in 内言語 differ to what's generally used in 外言語
  - Compatibility of 内言語 and 外言語 becomes key especially in conversations- hence the importance of learning jargon and making sure that its definition is an exact match to your personal understanding.
