## Terminal Usage

Prof's directions -> for windows
**For Mac**
* Split screen -> Cmd + D
* Exit split screen -> Cmd + Shift + D
* **for emacs** when in doubt-> cmd x + cmd c (exits emacs entirely, but confirms save beforehand)
  
## My_help Usage
* Purpose: Store information on how certain softwares (ex.: emacs) are used.
* -l (or list): shows a list of instruction files that are stored
* help: shows list of commands that can be used
* edit [PAGE]: edit instruction file in emacs

## Class Notes
* "Shell" (ex.: zsh, fish) directly comes from seashells, and "kernels" are what's inside of those shells
  * "Kernels" -> the core part of an operating system that manages operations and hardware
* Layers go from language -> editor -> shell -> os
  * Makes sense when considering why we compile files in terminal (that uses a shell) when running a program
