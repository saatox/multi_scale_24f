** Basic Grammar for Ruby

1-puts
- Hello World on terminal

2-name 
- How to use variables with options (if empty(default value): 'x' if not: 'y')
- How to incorporate other variable's values into strings

3-array 
- How to have multiple values in a single variable (array)
- How to concatinate two values in an output

4-method
- How to define+call functions

5-loop 
- Different ways of creating a loop and how each version differs     
- Show how many loops are conducted when defining with numbers (<= or <)   
- Call files from directory

Color_opt
- How to print in color on terminal (usage of library 'colorize')
- Usage of if/else statements on ruby (basic grammar of statements)
- Usage of opts (specific to ruby(?))
- Usage of .each (meaning for each element in array do the following)
- Usage of 'next if': skips the following command ('goes next') if the conditional is true
    eg.: skips the system command if dryrun is true
- Command 'system' runs the instructions instead of just printing it on terminal

When_usage
- Usage of 'when' statements as an alternative to if/else statements
- Can be compared with Color_opt: the programs do the same exact thing using different statements

Commit_opt
- Closer to the final auto_git program 
- Changes the commit command before it is executed, depending on the option requested by the user
- Includes commit message to the command so it doesn't have to be input seperately
