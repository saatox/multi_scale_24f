#+title: Org Usage

* Heading 1 is created using a singular "*" sign.

Regular text, *bold text*, /italicized text/, _underlined_, +strikethrough+

** Smaller headings/sub-headings

*** Even smaller headings

- lists
+ another list
    * or like this
        * even further like this
    + can go back to this
    - any one of these work
    * but when using "*", indentations are important
        * to differentiate from a header 

** Other tips
- "\\" to create new line
- include #+OPTIONS: ^:nil to disable automatic superscripts and subscripts
