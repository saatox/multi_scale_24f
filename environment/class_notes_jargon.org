* About Shell/Shell Commands
TLDR -> the language used in terminal (ex.: ls, cd)

** Origin
  - "Shell" (ex.: zsh, fish) directly comes from seashells, and "kernels" are what's inside of those shells
  - "Kernels" -> the core part of an operating system that manages operations and hardware
** Layers 
  - Goes from language -> editor -> shell -> os
  - Makes sense when considering why we compile files in terminal (that uses a shell) when running a program
** Zsh
  - Default shell for Mac
  - Open source (can be used on any device)
  - Preferred and therefore preinstalled on the mac due to its quality
** Bash
  - Default for Windows and Linux
** Fish
  - Not default but can be installed
  - Pros: Coloring in terminal (ex.: to differentiate files and folders) are done by default, lightweight
  - Cons: Due to it being lightweight (contains simple functions compared to Zsh), requires customizations whereas Zsh has more functions set up by default

* md VS html+org

  - html+org looks nicer when opened through terminal
  - Both formats can be tested on VSCode using "Open Preview" option
