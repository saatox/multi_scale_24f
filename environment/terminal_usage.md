## Terminal Usage

Prof's directions -> for windows

**For Mac**
* Cmd + D -> split screen
* Cmd + Shift + D -> exit split screen
* Ls -vCFG -> prints ls contents in color to differentiate files with folders
* Head -23 FILENAME.file -> opens file in terminal
* **for emacs** when in doubt-> cmd x + cmd c (exits emacs entirely, but confirms save beforehand)
  
## My_help Usage
* Purpose: Store information on how certain softwares (ex.: emacs) are used.
* -l (or list): shows a list of instruction files that are stored
* help: shows list of commands that can be used
* edit [PAGE]: edit instruction file in emacs


## Other Commands etc.
* Can change default settings including appearance, keyboard shortcuts, and autoruns (Prof's directions->Windows only)
  * Take note of clashes when changing keyboard shortcuts
  * Change default settings in order to avoid irreversible mistakes
  * Can also change which screen the cursor focuses on when using split panes
* Bin -> where user specified commands are kept
